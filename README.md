# Hostel Gerente

The software project named **HOSTEL GERENTE** is an enhanced hostel :hotel: management system that help us to manage some of the working aspects of a hostel efficiently and effectively. The hostel manager is the admin. The system allows the admin to keep entire records associated
with the hostel digitally and also help in managing the activities of it more easily. The hostel residents are the users and they can 
easily register with the system and do operations like fee payment, swap rooms etc. very easily.

“HOSTEL GERENTE” is an online website that the hostel residents can use to get the service they want without having to step out of the 
door. The user :mens: can register to the site easily and can avail the services provided in the system. Admin controls and coordinates every service provided by the system and also processes the user requests.

### The main modules include:
  - Admin 
  - User
  
### The main objectives of the proposed system are:

  * To make the users life more simple. 
  * To omit the drawback of the existing system.
  * To minimize the time utilization
  * To access the information easily.
  * Efficient record keeping.
  * Make available the better service to the users more efficiently.
  * Perform operations like searching for data based on filters possible.

The system allows the users to maintain their profile, request for changing rooms, apply for vacating rooms, pay mess fee and rent. 
The contact facility allows users to contact the hostel authority for requests, suggestions, complaints etc. and to reply to the admin’s
messages.The admin can process the user requests like registration applications, room swap :arrows_counterclockwise: requests, vacate applications etc. Admin can search for student details based on filters like student name, course, place, room type etc. Admin can also maintain pros and cons of students for future references.
